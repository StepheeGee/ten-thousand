## Project: The Ten Thousand Game

### Author: Student/Group Name

### Description: 

10,000 is a classic dice game that combines luck and strategy. The game is played with six dice, and the objective is to score points by rolling specific combinations. The first player to reach 10,000 points wins.

1. **Objective:**
   - The goal is to be the first player to reach a predetermined point total, often 10,000 points.

2. **Setup:**
   - Players take turns rolling six dice.

3. **Scoring:**
   - Players score points based on specific combinations rolled:
     - Single 1: 100 points
     - Single 5: 50 points
     - Three of a kind (other than 1s and 5s): 100 times the face value (e.g., three 2s = 200 points)
     - Three 1s: 1,000 points
     - Four or more of a kind (other than 1s and 5s): Double the points for a three-of-a-kind for each additional die (e.g., four 3s = 300 points, five 3s = 600 points)
     - Straight (1-2-3-4-5-6): 1,500 points

4. **Rolling and Decision Making:**
   - After each roll, the player must set aside scoring dice and can choose to roll the remaining dice for additional points.
   - If a roll does not score any points, the player loses all points scored in that turn, and their turn ends.

5. **Ending a Turn:**
   - A player can choose to end their turn and bank the points earned, or they can continue rolling, risking a total loss of points in this round, to accumulate more points.

6. **Winning:**
   - The first player to reach the agreed-upon point total (e.g., 10,000 points) or surpass it in a final round wins the game.
